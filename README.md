This dataset consists of over 1 million tweets. We have also performed various data analysis and data visualizations to gain useful insights. We the trained Machine Learning Models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes on this Dataset.

We then used the already trained models to predict sentiment score of the tweets of a table in MYSQL Database(this is a different table from the above dataset). We populated the database table with the predicted sentiment score. 

We performed data analysis on this table and ran queries to gain useful insights.
